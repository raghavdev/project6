What Is Views Slideshow Xtra?
-----------------------------

The Views Slideshow Xtra module is a placeholder module that includes a set of
sub-modules that provide additional functionality for the Views Slideshow module. 
The Views Slideshow Xtra module is not intended to be enabled directly, rather the 
sub-modules in the /views_slideshow_xtra/modules directory should be enabled as
required.

Sub-modules
-----------

1. Views Slideshow Examples: When enabled the Views Slideshow Example module
creates a slide content type, slidesshow taxonomy vocabulary, slideshow view,
and example slide content.  The module serves as a "Starter Kit", in that enabling
the module creates working slideshows, which can be used as a starting point
for your slideshows. 

2. Views Slideshow Overlay: Provides overlay support for the Views Slideshow module.
This is accomplished by adding an additional display to a Views Slideshow view, 
which has a special plug-in that renders content placed in specific fields in the slide
content type at specific coordinates (overlayed) on the slide.

For more information, see the README.txt file of the respective module.
